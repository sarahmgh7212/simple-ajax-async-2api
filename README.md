# simple-ajax-async-2api
In this project we used two APIs:

1.[Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/)

The Datamuse API is a word-finding query engine for developers. You can use it in your apps to find words that match a given set of constraints and that are likely in a given context. You can specify a wide variety of constraints on meaning, spelling, sound, and vocabulary in your queries, in any combination.

What is it good for?
Applications use the API for a wide range of features, including autocomplete on text input fields, search relevancy ranking, assistive writing apps, word games, and more.

We used this API for processing GET requests in our code.

2.[Rebrandly API](https://developers.rebrandly.com/)

Rebrandly is the industry-leading link management platform to brand, track and share short URLs using a custom domain name.

We used this API for processing POST requests in our code.
